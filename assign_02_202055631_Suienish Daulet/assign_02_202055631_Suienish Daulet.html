            <p>Hello everyone! As you might already see, my name is Suienish Daulet. I am a PNU student from Kazakhstan majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. Now, I am trying to become better in programming to find an internship or job to gain some experience. I am studying at the university and practicing my skills through different courses on the internet. Also, I go to the gym and try to stay fit because I lead a sitting life. In my free time, I play basketball and watch movies. I am a huge movie guy. My favorite actor is Christian Bale, and my favorite movie is maybe "Lalaland" or "Oldboy". Majorly I study SWIFT to become an IOS developer but I also try to study WebDEV, Data Analysis, and Machine learning as I am not yet sure which field of programming to choose. Hope that will be enough. Nice to meet you!</p>
